This flutter project is fundamentally built to cater two Front-end designs, one that runs on android hence making it a mobile application, and another that runs on google chrome for common web-page UI interface (not limited only to chrome but also other web readers such as firefox or safari). 

The project is a continuation of the previous project where weather API is used. It has basically two pages, the main page that fetches the API from api.weatherapi.com and the second page that fetches from api.openweathermap.org, hence the occasional differences in city names. One of the reasons is so that the main page could bear more information, in this case a picture, that depicts the weather more animatedly. 

One of the challenges with working in flutter, therefore subjectively, is the immediate appearance of the widget tree where it was seemingly already full with blocks of lines and comments, primarily in the Scaffold area. It takes some time to get used to which one is our comments and which one is the default flutter description. Outcome-appearance wise, flutter seems to be more fixated than the other front-end frameworks for example compared to React JavaScript. The widget somehow is also easier to be set based on the already existing template from flutter itself.

The use of setState in flutter would occasionally reminds the use of useState in React, with both serves the same purpose of rendering the state of the program, in this case setState in flutter that renders the UI interface and useState in react that renders the variables. However, what is more easier to flutter in the use of setState is that it does not return any value (while setState React does) and therefore the usage of setState is more direct and practical.
